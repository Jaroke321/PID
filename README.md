# PID
Example of a PID controller in C++</br>
</br> In this example the PID object is used to store error measurements and to calculate the steering angle.
</br> In the main.cpp script the initialization values can be seen as well as the speed limit that was put on the 
</br> car in order for it to be tested.
</br> The simulator that was used required a steering angle between _1 and 1. This was also checked in the main.cpp script
